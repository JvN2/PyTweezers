# VmbPy [![python version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Python API of the [Vimba X SDK](https://www.alliedvision.com)

Vimba X is a fully GenICam compliant SDK and the successor of Vimba. VmbPy is the Python API that is
provided by this SDK. It provides access to the full functionality of Vimba X in a pythonic way,
allowing for rapid development of applications.

# Installation

To use VmbPy an installation of Vimba X and Python >= 3.7 are required. A ready-to-install packaged
`.whl` file of VmbPy can be found as part of the Vimba X installation, or be downloaded from our
[github release page](https://github.com/alliedvision/VmbPy/releases). The `.whl` can be installed
as usual via the `pip install` command.

## Optional dependencies

For some functionality of VmbPy optional dependencies (also called "extras") are required. These
provide for example integration into numpy and OpenCV, as well as some additional code analysis
tools that are used in our full test suite. The following extras are defined for VmbPy:

- numpy: Enables conversion of `VmbPy.Frame` objects to numpy arrays
- opencv: Similar to above but ensures that the numpy arrays are valid OpenCV images
- test: Additional tools such as `flake8`, `mypy`, and `coverage` only necessary for executing
  `run_tests.py`

### Yocto on NXP i.MX8 and OpenCV

The GPU in i.MX8 systems requires using the system-wide opencv-python package. When you create the
Python environment, please use the `--system-site-packages` flag to include the system-wide OpenCV
package.

If you don't set up a separate environment, a warning is shown during the VmbPy installation. You
can ignore this warning.

# Differences to VimbaPython

VmbPy is the successor of VimbaPython. As such it shares many similarities, but in some places major
differences exist. An overview of the differences between VimbaPython and VmbPy can be found in the
migration guide, that is part of the Vimba X SDK documentation.

# Usage

Below is a minimal example demonstrating how to print all available cameras detected by VmbPy. It
highlights the general usage of VmbPy. More complete code examples can be found in the `Examples`
directory.

```python
import vmbpy

vmb = vmbpy.VmbSystem.get_instance()
with vmb:
    cams = vmb.get_all_cameras()
    for cam in cams:
        print(cam)
```

## General guidelines

VmbPy makes use of the Python context manager to perform setup and teardown tasks for the used
object instances. This ensures the correct call order for the underlying VmbC functions and
guarantees, that resources are made available and freed as expected even in cases where errors
occur. One example is shown in the example above, where the context of the `VmbSystem` object must
be entered to start the underlying VmbC API.

VmbPy is also designed to closely resemble VmbCPP. While VmbPy aims to be as performant as possible,
it might not be fast enough for performance critical applications. In that case the similar
structure of VmbPy and VmbCPP makes it easy to migrate an existing VmbPy code base to VmbCPP.

## Running the test suite

VmbPy provides a number of unittest as part of the [Github
repository](https://github.com/alliedvision/VmbPy). The test suite can be run in two ways. Either by
using the test discovery mechanic of Python's `unittest` module, or via the provided `run_tests.py`.

### Unittest discovery

Python's unittest module can be used to discover the test cases of VimbaPython automatically. This
can be useful as it provides good integration into third party tools like test explorers. To execute
the entire test suite the following command can be run inside the `Tests` directory of this
repository:

```
python -m unittest discover -v -p *_test.py
```

This will open the first camera, that Vimba detects on the system. If multiple cameras are connected
to the system, an unexpected device may be selected. In this situation it is recommended to specify
the ID of the device that should be used for test case execution. This is done by setting the
environment variable `VMBPY_DEVICE_ID`. A convenient way to get the IDs of currently available
devices is running the `list_cameras.py` example.

Execute entire test suite using camera with ID `DEV_PLACEHOLDER`

<details><summary>Windows</summary>

```
set VMBPY_DEVICE_ID=DEV_PLACEHOLDER
python -m unittest discover -v -p *_test.py
```
</details>

<details><summary>Linux</summary>

```
export VMBPY_DEVICE_ID=DEV_PLACEHOLDER
python -m unittest discover -v -p *_test.py
```
</details>

### `run_tests.py`

The provided helper script `run_tests.py` may also be used to execute the test suite. In addition to
the test cases, it also executes `flake8`, `mypy`, and `coverage`. These additional tools need to be
installed in the used Python environment. For convenience they are grouped as an optional dependency
of VmbPy with the name `test` that can be added to the `pip install` command used to install VmbPy.

`run_tests.py` provides a helpful command line interface that can be used to configure which tests
to run and how the output should be structured. To get an overview of the available options the
following command can be executed to generate the usage description.

```
python run_tests.py -h
```
